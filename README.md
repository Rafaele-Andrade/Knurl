" [â€¦] if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn." 

We all know this chinese proverb from Tao Zu. Sharing digital content and open scource documentation also means teaching people how to think, not to eat in a fast food. My understanding of open scource culture is based on this though: I am teaching people. Here you will find simulations of the structures that I use on Knurls system.
