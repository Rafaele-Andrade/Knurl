# Knurl

Knurl is an instrument-interface exploring concepts of interactivity and polyphony in the practice of a bowed string instrument. It is a creation of the composer and cellist Rafaele Andrade, it runs and modifies live synthesis sounds while autonomous and interactive systems can influence it. Knurl can be considered:

* Sensor-based string instrument: The strings become a trigger to play, stop, plan or set controllers for sound
* Multiple voice control interface: The ability to control multiple voices determining different goals, agent and controllers for each sound
* Semi-Autonomous instrument: The ability to cooperate with its context and readapt into its boundaries
